# ðŸŒŒ Deep Space Objects Classification and Detection Tool  

This project provides an automated approach to identify and analyze **Deep Space Objects (DSOs)** through two main functionalities: **classification** and **detection**. It uses state of the art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and YOLO detection models to classify and detect three categories of DSOs: **galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters**.  

## Project Overview  

The project explores **deep learning** techniques using **Transfer Learning** on pretrained CNN models (**VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet**) for classification, and modern object detection algorithms (**YOLOv9 and YOLOv11n**) to locate and identify DSOs within images.

- **Classification**: Classify DSOs into galaxies, nebulae, or star clusters while comparing model performance.
- **Detection**: Identification and localization of multiple DSOs within an image.
- Web application for vizualization and model performance demo.

### Web Application  

The project includes a **Flask-based web application** that allows users to:
- **Upload images** for classification and detection.
- Receive **classification predictions and detection results**.
- Vizualize the **actiavtion map** for multiple convolutional layers of the selected model
- Explore **model performance and visual detection outcomes** through the interface.
