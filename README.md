# ðŸŒŒ Deep Space Objects Classification Tool  

This project aims to provide an automated way to differentiate between **three** classes of Deep Space Objects (DSO): **galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters**. Using a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture** built on **pretrained models**, the model is trained to classify images of these objects with high accuracy.  

## Project Overview  

The project explores **deep learning** to analyze and classify images of deep space objects. Through **Transfer Learning** on **VGG16, ResNet50, and EfficientNet**, the model learns to identify intricate patterns within the dataset.  

- Users can classify **galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters** while comparing the performance of different models.  
- The web application provides an interface to interact with the models and allows users to provide **feedback** on classification accuracy.  
- This approach **automates** the classification process and provides a **scalable solution** for analyzing large astronomical image datasets.  

### Web Application  
In addition to the AI model, the project includes a **Flask-based web application** that allows users to:  
- **Upload** images of deep space objects.
- Receive **real-time** predictions from the trained model.
- Explore **model performance and classification results** through an intuitive UI.
