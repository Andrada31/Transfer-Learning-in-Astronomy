# Deep Space Objects Classification Tool

This project aims to provide an automated way to differentiate between two classes of Deep Space Objects (DSO): galaxies and nebulae. Using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, the model is trained to classify images of these objects with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

The project leverages the power of deep learning to analyze and classify images of deep space objects. By using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model is able to learn and identify intricate patterns within the images that distinguish galaxies from nebulae. This approach not only automates the classification process but also provides a scalable solution for analyzing large datasets of astronomical images.

In addition to the AI model, the project includes a web application built with Flask. This web app allows users to upload images of deep space objects and receive real-time predictions from the trained model. The user-friendly interface ensures that even those with limited technical knowledge can easily interact with the system and obtain accurate classifications.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the AI model and backend.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used to build the web application.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: Libraries used for building and training the deep learning model.
- **HTML and CSS**: Used for creating the web application's interface.
- **React**: Used for building the frontend of the web application.

## Features
Deep Learning Models: Users can toggle between VGG, ResNet, and EfficientNet for classification.
Web-Based Interface: React interactive UI for easy exploration.
REST API: Flask backend for model inference and data handling.
